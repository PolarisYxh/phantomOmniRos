phantom_omni
============

ROS Node for Sensable Phantom Omni devices

Requires the [omni_description](https://github.com/danepowell/omni_description) package. 

Parameters:
- ~omni_name (default: omni1)

Publishes:
- OMNI_NAME_joint_states (sensor_msgs/JointState): The state of each of the omni's joints.
- OMNI_NAME_button (phantom_omni/PhantomButtonEvent): Events for the grey and white buttons.

Subscribes:
- OMNI_NAME_force_feedback (phantom_omni/OmniFeedback): Force feedback to be displayed on the omni. Takes a force and a position. If you simultaneously click the grey and white buttons, the omni will 'lock' to the position.

This is based on the [original phantom_omni package](http://www.ros.org/wiki/phantom_omni). However, it has several advantages:
- Catkinized build system
- Compatibility with ROS Groovy
- Uses URDF description of Omni and the robot_state_publisher instead of hardcoded transforms.
- Improved auto-calibration
- Streamlined code / organization / bug fixes.
- Defaults to gravity compensation mode (instead of locking to the 'zero' position).

To see it in action, simply:
roslaunch phantom_omni omni.launch
